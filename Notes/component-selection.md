# Component Selection Notes

## Inductor
Chosen for high saturation current and low DCR to support both charging and boost operation without entering saturation under peak load.

## Output MOSFET
Selected for low RDS(on) at logic-level gate drive.
Thermal performance and copper area are more important than headline current rating.

## Capacitors
Ceramic bulk capacitors are used at battery, VBUS, and VOUT nodes to minimize ripple and support transient loads.
