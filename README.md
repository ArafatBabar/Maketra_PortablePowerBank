This repository documents the power-management section of a single-cell Li-ion power bank design based on the SW6208 integrated power bank SoC.  The SW6208 combines battery charging, boost conversion, and USB fast-charge protocol handling into a single device, making it well suited for compact 1S power bank architectures.
