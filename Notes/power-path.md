# Power Path Overview

The SW6208 sits between the protected battery node and the USB connectors.

During charging:
- USB input is converted to a regulated battery charging current

During discharge:
- Battery voltage is boosted to a regulated USB output

The same inductor is shared between both modes, simplifying the power stage and reducing component count.
